## Historical Context

libnix was originally developed in the 1990s as an alternative to ixemul.library for Amiga-specific GCC development. The library was designed to be:

- **Amiga-specific** rather than Unix-compatible
- **Lightweight** with minimal dependencies
- **ANSI C compliant** for portability
- **Free from FSF copyright** to avoid source distribution requirements

The public domain status was chosen to ensure maximum freedom for Amiga developers while avoiding the complexities of copyleft licenses.

## Legal Notice

This software is not copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Therefore, you neither need to include sources nor objects together with your executable. This was a deliberate design choice to make libnix more suitable for commercial Amiga development compared to GPL-licensed alternatives (such as GCC itself, or ixemul.library)
